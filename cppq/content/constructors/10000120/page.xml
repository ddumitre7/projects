<explanation>
The following may look like an error, but it works fine.
<code>X a = {10}; </code>Like structures, class objects can be initialized.
The line <code>X b = a;</code> calls copy constructor and is same as <code>X b(a);</code>.
Please note that, if we don't write our own copy constructor, then compiler creates a default copy constructor which assigns data members one object to other object.
